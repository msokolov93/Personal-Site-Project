This website was designed as a digital creative portfolio 
and showoff for learning new programming skills (html5 canvas)

For some reason you cant find any physics theory on this website. 
Sadly, but for the same reason you wont find my college degree.

What always interested me the most - 
means of communications between a machine and a person. 
How to make it easier for the person to get involved in this communication?

I studied design of interfaces, web,
tried to program native mobile applications.
But the hardest lesson was - that you cant do anything great all by yourself.

So now im looking for the right people to make great products with - a job.
