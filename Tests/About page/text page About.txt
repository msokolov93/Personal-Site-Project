<p>What always interested me the most - means of communications between a machine and a person. 
How to make it easier for the person to get involved in this communication? </p>
<br>
<p>I've worked with clouds, web apps, design of interfaces, 
and even tried to program native mobile application once. </p>
<br>
<p>I'm looking for the right people to make great products with. </p>
